        <p>I love PLC (programmable logic controllers) programming, also known as ladder logic/programming. For some unknown reason I was really good at it! It comes very naturally to me, the logic, the flow.

          It‚Äôs what controls most traffic lights, production lines‚Ä¶ I used to help program Dyson vacuum production lines for example.

          Then I moved into a computer programming role for an engineering company, which was not better, just different, I built the company website (very difficult back then pre 2000).

          I somehow ended up managing all the IT and network for them and also then got sent out to sort any computer issues to all their clients‚Ä¶ Cadbury (got discounted chocolate, shame I‚Äôm not into chocolate much).</p>
